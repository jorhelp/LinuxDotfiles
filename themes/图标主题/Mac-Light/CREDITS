MacOs Sierra CT is a set of icons originally based on macbuntu and ispirado in the design of macOS.
the original set has icons exclusively in "png" format however my set looks to replace all the icons with svg files that are lighter.
I constantly add new svg icons, derived from this, the package each time has a smaller weight.


MacOS sierra ct also has an icons extracted from the following projects:

Mac OS X Icon by BALASAKTHIGOPAL https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1012200/

Mac OSX Circle for Elementary OS by III https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1221970

Ant√º Classic FABIANALEXIS https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1188272/



In addition some of the icons are inspired by the work of other designers, site one:
